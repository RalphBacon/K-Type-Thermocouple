A K-Type Thermocouple Display for just a few dollars? Accurate and easy to use.

Wandering through the technical, Far Eastern web sites I stumbled across this delightful, high-temperature display, complete with K-Type Thermocouple. This can read temperatures into the high hundreds of degrees Centigrade and would be great for barbecues, clay ovens, pizza ovens, wood-burning stove chimneys and the like.

It's simplicity itself to connect up to a 12v PSU (I found it worked well at 9v too, and even a bit lower before it all became a bit unstable).

The M6 threaded sensor can be bolted to the metal case of a BBQ, for example, or the metal flue of a wood-burning stove by using a RivNut - a device that turns into a captive nut once tightened. See the video link below to see exactly how to install it using a tool, but you can install it without that too, just not so quickly.

You even get a burger cooking tip, a quiz question and more!
